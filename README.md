### Summary

I built a to-do app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app runs in the web browser.

The app allows the user to:
1. Add tasks
2. Delete tasks
3. Mark tasks complete or incomplete

To add a task, type your task into the text box on the page and click the ‘ADD’ button. To delete a task, click the red ‘X’ to right of the task that you want deleted. To mark a task complete or incomplete, click on the checkbox to the left of the applicable task.
